name: synchronize-subtitles
description: Use ONLY when the user wants to re-synchronize a local .srt file against a video file in the same folder using ffsubsync, and rename the result to <video>.es.srt — or to <video>.srt (same name as the video) if the video filename contains "2160p", which is the only naming check performed. Triggers on phrases like "sincroniza el subtítulo", "sincroniza el .srt con la película", "ajusta el timing del .srt", "re-sincroniza el subtítulo", "sync the subtitle", "fix subtitle offset". Auto-detects a single video and a single .srt in the current folder; aborts with a clear error if more than one of either is found. Supports .mkv/.mp4/.avi/.mov/.m4v. Overwrites an existing target .srt without prompting. If ffsubsync fails or is unavailable, preserves the original .srt and still renames it to the target name (better a misnamed but intact file than an aborted run).

# Synchronize Subtitles

A workflow for the agent to re-synchronize a local `.srt` against a video in the same folder using `ffsubsync`, and rename the result to `<basename>.es.srt` (or `<basename>.srt` if the video is 2160p).

The user runs the bundled script. **No flags, no configuration knobs.** The script auto-detects the video and the `.srt` in the current folder (or in a folder passed as the sole argument), runs `ffsubsync` with the same parameters and thresholds used by `search-subtitles`, and renames the result.

## When to use this skill
Use this skill when the user has **already** obtained a `.srt` (manually, from another site, or as a leftover from a previous download) and wants to align its timing with a local video. The user typically:

- Has a folder with one video and one `.srt` that are out of sync.
- Wants the result saved as `<video>.es.srt` (the convention auto-recognized by VLC, Plex, Kodi, Jellyfin, MPC-HC), or as `<video>.srt` when the video is 2160p.
- Does not want to (or cannot) re-download from OpenSubtitles.

Do NOT use this skill when:
- The user wants to **download** a subtitle from the internet (use `search-subtitles`).
- The user wants to **extract** subtitles already embedded in the video (`ffmpeg`/`mkvextract`).
- The user wants to **convert** between subtitle formats (`.ass` → `.srt`, etc.).
- The user wants to **normalize** European Spanish to LATAM (use `search-subtitles`; this skill does not touch subtitle text).
- The folder contains more than one video or more than one `.srt` (ambiguous pairing; the script aborts with a clear message).

## Naming convention
The only naming check performed is: does the video filename contain `2160p` (case-insensitive)?

- **2160p video** → the output is `<video_basename>.srt` (same name as the video).
- **Any other video** → the output is `<video_basename>.es.srt`.

In both cases the output name is derived from the video, regardless of the input `.srt` name. The `.es.srt` convention matches the one used by `search-subtitles` so that media players auto-pick the right file. To re-synchronize, just run the script again; it will overwrite the existing target file.

## Workflow

### 1. Locate the target folder
- If the cwd already contains the video and the `.srt`, use it.
- Otherwise, take the folder path the user provides (absolute or relative to cwd).
- Glob for the configured video extensions: `*.mkv`, `*.mp4`, `*.avi`, `*.mov`, `*.m4v`.
- Glob for `*.srt` files.

### 2. Resolve the video ↔ srt pair
- Exactly **one** video and **one** `.srt` in the folder is required.
- If zero of either: abort with a clear error (exit code 1).
- If more than one of either: abort with a clear error explaining that the user should remove the extras (exit code 2).

### 3. Confirm the environment (silent)
- Run `python --version`.
- Check `shutil.which("ffsubsync")`; if missing, auto-install via `pip install ffsubsync`.
- If `ffsubsync` cannot be installed, the script will still rename the `.srt` to the target name and report that synchronization did not happen. The user's `.srt` is preserved as-is.

### 4. Run the bundled script
```
python scripts/sync_subs.py [carpeta]
```

The script handles everything end-to-end:

- **Detection** is automatic; no flags. If the user passes a folder, it must be the only positional argument.
- **Synchronization** uses `ffsubsync` with the same flags and thresholds as `search-subtitles/scripts/download_subs.py`:
  - `ffsubsync <video> -i <srt> -o <stem>.synced.srt --skip-sync-on-low-quality --min-score=1000 --quality-max-offset-seconds=600`
  - Defence: if the computed sync has a score below 1000 or an offset above 10 minutes, `ffsubsync` writes no output (we preserve the original `.srt`).
  - Cost: ~30-40 s for a feature film (audio extraction + speech-activity detection). Language-agnostic.
- **Encoding normalization** is run on the final `.srt` (whether the original or the synchronized one) with the same fallback chain as `search-subtitles`: `utf-8-sig` → `utf-8` → `cp1252` → `latin-1`. If the file was decoded via a single-byte encoding, it is re-written as UTF-8 so downstream consumers work with a consistent file.
- **Renaming** moves the final `.srt` to the target name: `<video>.srt` if the video filename contains `2160p` (case-insensitive), otherwise `<video>.es.srt`. This is the only naming check. If the target file already exists, it is overwritten without prompting (per the design decision).
- **Failure handling** is permissive: if `ffsubsync` is missing, returns non-zero, times out, or produces an unusable output, the script keeps the original `.srt` and still renames it to the target name. The rationale: the user asked for a file at that name; a misnamed but intact file is more useful than an aborted run that leaves the `.srt` with its original (possibly meaningless) name.

### 5. Verify and report
- After the script finishes, list the folder and confirm the presence of the target file (`<video>.srt` for 2160p videos, `<video>.es.srt` otherwise).
- Show the script's own summary line: the offset applied (if any), the score, and the final filename.
- Categories in the script's stdout:
  - `OK -> <target>.srt` — success, with the offset and score from `ffsubsync` (or a note that ffsubsync was skipped).
  - `ERROR: <reason>` — abort before any rename, with the reason.
- If a result is reported as "ffsubsync no se aplico" and the user reports poor sync, the options are: try a different source `.srt`, manually run `ffsubsync` with custom parameters, or re-download via `search-subtitles` and let it auto-sync.

## Known pitfalls
- `ffsubsync` infers the output format from the file extension. The intermediate file MUST end in `.srt` (e.g. `<stem>.synced.srt`), not `.srt.tmp` — otherwise ffsubsync raises `NotImplementedError: unsupported output format: tmp`.
- `ffsubsync` decodes the audio and runs speech-activity detection, which takes ~30-40 s for a feature film. It works on any language because it compares the *timing* of speech segments, not the transcription itself.
- The script does not handle the case of multiple videos or multiple `.srt` files. This is intentional: silently picking one would be worse than asking the user to clean up the folder. The error message names the count and the extension.
- If the user has both `<video>.srt` and `<video>.es.srt` in the folder, the script will abort (two `.srt` files). The user should remove the one they do not want to sync.
- The script auto-installs `ffsubsync` via pip if missing. This requires the user's environment to allow pip installs; in locked-down environments the install will fail and the script will fall back to "rename only".
- On Windows consoles, the script forces UTF-8 stdout (`sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")`) so that `á`, `é`, `í`, etc. print correctly.

## Reusable script reference

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/sync_subs.py` | Re-synchronizer. Auto-detects video and `.srt`, runs `ffsubsync`, renames to `<video>.srt` (2160p) or `<video>.es.srt` (rest). No flags; takes an optional folder path as the sole argument. |

Exit codes:
- `0` — success (synchronized or at least renamed).
- `1` — no video or no `.srt` in the folder.
- `2` — usage error (too many arguments, invalid folder, multiple videos, multiple `.srt`).
- `3` — `ffsubsync` unavailable and could not be installed. The `.srt` is still renamed, so this is informational, not fatal.
